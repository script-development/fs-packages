features:
  - title: Factory Pattern
    details: Every package exports a createXxxService() factory that returns a plain object. No classes, no singletons, no hidden state. You control when and where services are created.
  - title: Loose Coupling
    details: Packages communicate through structural typing (duck types), not direct imports. Swap implementations without changing consumers. fs-theme doesn't import fs-storage — it accepts anything with get() and put().
  - title: Middleware Architecture
    details: HTTP, loading, dialog, and router all support composable middleware pipelines. Register a handler, get an unregister function back. Stack behaviors without modifying source code.
  - title: 100% Test Coverage
    details: Every package maintains 100% code coverage and 90% mutation testing score. An 8-gate CI pipeline runs audit, format, lint, build, typecheck, package lint, coverage, and mutation testing on every PR.
  - title: Component Agnostic
    details: Toast and dialog services manage lifecycle and state — you bring your own Vue components. No opinionated UI. Your design system, our plumbing.
  - title: Type Safe
    details: Built with TypeScript 5.9+ in strict mode. Router navigation is type-checked against your route definitions. Translation keys are validated at compile time. No stringly-typed APIs.

|---------|-------------|
| [fs-http](/packages/http) | HTTP service factory with middleware architecture |
| [fs-storage](/packages/storage) | localStorage service factory with prefix namespacing |
| [fs-helpers](/packages/helpers) | Tree-shakeable utilities: deep copy, type guards, case conversion |

### Services

Vue-powered reactive services for common application concerns.

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [fs-theme](/packages/theme) | Reactive dark/light mode with system preference detection |
| [fs-loading](/packages/loading) | Loading state service with HTTP middleware integration |
| [fs-toast](/packages/toast) | Component-agnostic toast notification queue |
| [fs-dialog](/packages/dialog) | Component-agnostic dialog stack with error middleware |
| [fs-translation](/packages/translation) | Type-safe reactive i18n with multi-locale support |

### Domain

| [fs-router](/packages/router) | Type-safe router with CRUD navigation and middleware pipeline |

## Quality Guarantees

Every package passes an 8-gate CI pipeline before it can be published:

1. **Security audit** — `npm audit` for known vulnerabilities
2. **Formatting** — oxfmt enforces consistent code style
3. **Linting** — oxlint catches bugs and anti-patterns
4. **Build** — tsdown compiles to dual ESM + CJS output
5. **Type checking** — TypeScript strict mode, no implicit any
6. **Package lint** — publint and attw verify package exports are correct
7. **Coverage** — 100% code coverage via vitest
8. **Mutation testing** — 90% mutation score via Stryker ensures tests actually verify behavior
