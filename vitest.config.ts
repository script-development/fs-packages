// blocks in packages/*/vitest.config.ts are ignored on the root run (verified
// empirically 2026-07-22 — an uncovered branch in packages/helpers exited 0 with
// projects loaded). Each glob key below is an independent threshold group, so a dip
// in one package fails the gate by name instead of drowning in a fleet aggregate.
// The per-package config blocks stay load-bearing for in-package runs (Stryker's
// vitest runner + `vitest run` from a package dir).
