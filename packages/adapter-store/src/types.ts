/**
 * Contract for binding server-initiated events (e.g. WebSocket broadcasts)
 * to an adapter-store. The store calls `subscribe` once at construction and
 * routes incoming events straight into its internal mutation path.
 *
 * This is a **closed** contract: the handlers are consumed inside the consumer's
 * `subscribe` body (wired to an event source) and are never returned, so they do
 * not reach the public store surface. The handlers the store passes are validating
 * wrappers, not the bare internal mutators — `onUpdate` rejects a payload that is
 * not an object with an integer `id`, and `onDelete` rejects a non-integer id, each
 * throwing `BroadcastPayloadError` so a malformed broadcast cannot corrupt store
 * state (`NaN` / `Infinity` / a non-integer float pass a `typeof === 'number'` check
 * yet break the keyspace, so the guard requires an integer). Because the channel
 * applies events without an HTTP round-trip, do not
 * re-export the handlers onto your own public surface — that would publish a
 * non-HTTP write path for arbitrary callers.
 *
 * `onPatch(id, changes)` merges `changes` shallowly into the row the store holds,
 * for channels with a frame-size ceiling where the producer sends only the fields
 * that changed. It rejects a non-integer `id`, a `changes` that is `null`, an
 * array, or a primitive, and a `changes` carrying an `id` key — an `id` inside the
 * merge would re-key the row. The check is on shape, not on the prototype: a class
 * instance passes and only its own enumerable fields merge. A patch for an id the store
 * does not hold is a no-op: no state reassignment and no storage write, because a
 * partial cannot become a full `T`. `onDelete` also does not throw on a missing id, but
 * it still reassigns state and calls `storageService.put`. Nested values replace the
 * stored value wholesale; there is no deep merge.

     * (it is the feature) and so can only be validated — `extend`'s leak can be designed

     *
     * Forward-compat: this guard keys on the *current* built-in set. Adding a built-in
