# fs-auth — decisions

Why this package is shaped the way it is. Every entry names a cost it accepts or
a limitation it lives with, so the argument sits here rather than in a comment
nobody dates. Canonical reasoning: **ADR-0050** (`adrs.script.nl`).

## D1 — A failed logout leaves the session standing; a REFUSED one confirms it is gone

_2026-09-14, Commander ruling. ADR-0050 § Resolved Questions, "Failed logout"._
_Amended 2026-09-16, Commander ruling, fix round 4._

`logout()` moves the machine on **success**, and on exactly one kind of failure.
On every other failure the state and the user are unchanged, no `sessionEnd`
listener fires, and nothing probes the server afterwards. ublgenie's `finally`
(tear down regardless) was rejected, and stays rejected.

**What the ruling protects, stated precisely — the amendment.** A cookie the
server still **honours** must never be reported as gone; the alternative sends
somebody to the entrance while their session is live. A **401 or 419 from the
logout endpoint is the server saying it does not honour it.** That is not a
failure to report, it is a sign-out to pass on. The original wording said
"success only" and so turned the server's clearest possible answer into a
`failed` the consumer had to interpret — with the expiry hook installed, into
two contradictory signals at once (D19).

- **401 / 419 on the logout POST** → outcome `{kind: 'signed_out'}`, the session
  ends **once** with `{reason: 'expired'}`, and nothing probes afterwards.
  `expired` and not `logout`: the server ended the session, and the person
  pressing the button only found out. The event carries no `returnTo` —
  `logout()` does not know where the person is, the same reason the
  revalidating-`me` path carries none (D14).
- **Every other failure** — a transport fault, 5xx, 403, 422, 429, and a
  rejection that is not the transport's at all (D13) — stays
  `{kind: 'failed'}`, session standing, no event.
- **A refused CSRF prime is never the server confirming anything.** The cookie
  route is not the logout endpoint, and with a failed prime the logout endpoint
  was never asked at all, so a 401 there is `failed` like any other prime
  failure. The prime and the POST are awaited in separate `try` blocks for
  exactly this reason, and a spec pins it — collapsing them back reds that one
  spec and nothing else.

## D2 — The session-end event carries the return-to

_2026-09-14, Commander ruling. ADR-0050 § Resolved Questions, "Return-to on session expiry"._

`handleSessionExpired(returnTo?)` passes `returnTo` through to the event. The
consumer's exit writes it under whatever query name the consumer uses; the
package picks none. kendo's expiry path gains what its login path already had.

## D3 — `user` is readonly outward, with one explicit writer

_2026-09-14, Commander ruling. ADR-0050 § Resolved Questions, "Is `user` writable from outside the store?"._

`setUser(next)` is the only writer, and it **throws a `TypeError`** when the
session is not `authenticated`. A profile update landing after expiry is a
defect the consumer has to see (ADR-0048), not a write to swallow. kendo's six
external `user.value` writes become `setUser` calls on adoption.

## D4 — The package fires; the consumer navigates

_2026-09-14, Commander ruling. ADR-0050 § Resolved Questions, "Who navigates on session end?"._

This package registers no navigation and owns no sink. lokalekeuze's
full-document load and kendo's router push are both consumer choices, and a
package cannot know which one it is inside.

## D5 — `login()` always confirms against `me`, and pays one extra request for it

_Amended 2026-09-21, 0.2.0. The confirm's non-authenticated answer is now
`unconfirmed`, not `refused` (D22)._

A successful login POST is not treated as proof of a session: `login()` calls
`loadSession()` and answers `authenticated` only if the machine says so. The
cost is one extra round trip on the login path. It buys a single source of
identity — `parseUser` runs in exactly one place, so no consumer can end up with
two readings of who is signed in.

The second cost, which the original entry did not name: a confirm that does not
authenticate is a failure mode the POST alone never had. It is answered as
`unconfirmed` rather than as a refusal, because the request that failed is the
confirm and not the credential exchange.

The open case: a consumer whose login body carries the user and whose `me` does
not. Nothing in the fleet is shaped that way today. If one appears, the answer is
argued here first; it is **not** a `loginYieldsUser` switch bolted on quietly.

## D6 — `/%2f%2fevil.com` is accepted

`resolveSafeRedirect` accepts percent-encoded slashes verbatim. They are a path
on the same origin at every sink a consumer can have — the server resolves them
and no URL parser ever sees a host. It is pinned in the vector table so that
turning it into a refusal requires bringing a case rather than a hunch.

The same rule refuses what actually is a vector: ASCII control characters and
whitespace. A browser strips tab, LF and CR _before_ parsing a URL, so
`/<TAB>/evil.com` becomes `//evil.com` at an `href`-shaped sink. The validator
never strips or normalises — a candidate that needed rewriting to be safe was
not safe, and a rewritten one is a different destination than was asked for.

## D7 — The package renders no copy

No sentences, no toasts, no i18n. `login()` and `logout()` return outcomes and
`onSessionEnd` fires events; every consumer writes its own words. This is why
2FA lives behind the `challenge` arm rather than inside the package: the package
admits the login deferred and refuses to guess what it deferred to.

## D8 — A listener's own failure is swallowed AND reported

`onSessionEnd` wraps each listener call, so one throwing listener does not cost
the others their notice that the session ended. Nothing is rethrown and nothing
is reported.

_Reversed 2026-09-16, fix round 7. Findings `7dfa378e93fe` (four lanes) and
`96910e278162`; **WR-1445 pulled into 0.1.0** rather than deferred to 0.2.0._

The original entry swallowed the fault and reported it nowhere, arguing that the
package "has no `console` it is entitled to write to as a library", so the only
choice was between losing one listener's fault and losing every later listener's
notification.

**That was a false dilemma, and our own sibling package refutes it.** fs-http's
`guarded()` (ADR-0037) does both: it swallows a middleware throw so the
interceptor chain survives, and it reports it — `console.error('[fs-http] …')`
by default, replaceable through `onMiddlewareError`. The Armory already holds
that a swallowed callback failure is loud by default. There was never a choice
to make; the entry simply did not look one package over.

So `CreateSessionStoreConfig` gains **`onListenerError`**, defaulting to a loud
`console.error` in `guarded()`'s exact shape with an `[fs-auth]` prefix, and
every listener failure routes to it. The sink **must not re-throw** — the same
rule and the same reason as `GuardedMiddlewareErrorHandler`: re-throwing
re-opens the failure the swallow closes and costs every later listener its
notice.

**Async listeners were losing failures silently, which is why the reversal could
not wait.** The listener type was `(event) => void`, and TypeScript lets an
`async` function satisfy it — so a consumer writing `onSessionEnd(async () => …)`
compiles, and its rejection never enters a synchronous `catch`. The type is now
`(event) => void | Promise<void>` and a returned thenable's rejection reaches the
same sink. **`endSession` stays synchronous**: the rejection is routed, never
awaited, because the single-flight guard is a synchronous read of the machine
(D16) and the session is already cleared before any listener runs.

_Raised and declined three times, 2026-09-16: findings `c27ad7f2bff2` (first
private round), `fe198b1f98cf` and its duplicate `1d444695cd1f` (second). The
stance above is unchanged and the recurrence is not evidence against it — it is
evidence that a silent swallow reads as a defect to anything scanning for one,
which it should. The follow-up is **WR-1445**: an `onListenerError` sink on the
store config, at parity with fs-http's `onMiddlewareError` (ADR-0037), in 0.2.0.
That gives the package the reporting channel it lacks today, at which point this
entry is superseded rather than re-argued._

## D9 — `registerAuthGuard` requires an injected `resolveReturnTo`

fs-router's before-route middleware receives the **matched route record**, whose
`path` is the pattern (`/employers/:id`) and not the URL anybody visited; the
signature is `(to, from)` and carries no location. kendo's own guard gets a third
`toLocation: {fullPath}` argument because kendo's router service supplies one —
fs-router `0.3.0` does not.

So the package cannot compute the return-to, and it will not read a browser
global to get it (D4, and the arch spec forbids it). `resolveReturnTo` is
therefore a **required** option, injected exactly as `isPublic` is. It is
deliberately not defaulted to `to.path`: that silently produces
`/employers/:id`, which is a return-to that looks right and goes nowhere.

The alternative is a change in fs-router — widening `BeforeRouteMiddleware` to
receive the normalised location. That is a sibling decision, not this package's
to take.

## D10 — `user` carries a type assertion on the way out

Vue's `readonly()` maps its argument through `DeepReadonly`, which does not
reduce for an unresolved generic, so `readonly(user)` types as
`Ref<DeepReadonly<TUser> | undefined>` and a consumer's own `TUser` is lost.
The assertion restores it.

The **runtime** guarantee is untouched: the exposed value is still Vue's readonly
proxy and still refuses a write, and the declared `Readonly<Ref<…>>` still
refuses one at compile time. Both are spec'd — a `@ts-expect-error` for the type
and an assertion on the unchanged value for the proxy.

## D11 — Six surviving mutants

_Fifth added in fix round 3; sixth in fix round 4, 2026-09-16. Score re-measured
at each: 98.00 → 97.71 → 97.61 → 97.67 → 97.71, and **97.74 at 0.2.0**
(2026-09-21, full run with the incremental file deleted: 266 mutants, 257
killed, 3 timed out, 6 survived). Rounds 5, 6 and 7 each added no new survivor,
and neither did 0.2.0 — the six below are exactly the six measured, in the same
six shapes. The only 0.2.0 change is to the third entry's quoted line: the
sentinel carries a `state` property now (D23), and emptying it is equivalent for
the same reason it always was._

The mutation gate is 90. Five survivors have no observable behaviour change; one
(the fifth) has one nobody can provoke on purpose. Named here so a later reader
does not re-derive them. **Three of the five equivalents are the same shape** —
a `!== undefined` narrowing written for the type checker in front of a
`Set.has`, which is already `false` for `undefined`. That is worth knowing before
anyone "fixes" the score by deleting one: the narrowing is what keeps the call
type-safe, and the set's behaviour is what makes the mutant equivalent.

- `issued += 1` → `issued -= 1`. The read epoch needs distinct successive values
  and a last-writer comparison; counting down satisfies both.
- `() => false` → `() => undefined` on the `isChallenge` default. Both falsy at
  the only place the value is read.
- `const SUPERSEDED = {status: undefined, body: undefined, state: undefined}` →
  `{}`. Every caller reads all three properties back as `undefined` either way —
  including `loadSession()`'s `read.state === undefined` check, which is what
  maps the sentinel to `undefined` at the public boundary (D23).
- `status !== undefined && SIGNED_OUT_STATUSES.has(status)` → `true && …`, now
  in `isSignedOutStatus` (`endpoints.ts`). It moved there in fix round 4 when
  `logout()` became its second reader — one survivor for one idiom, rather than
  the same equivalent mutant once per call site.
- `url !== undefined && ownEndpoints.has(url)` → `true && …` in `ownsRefusalOf`
  (D19). The same shape as the one above, for the same reason.
- `while (outcome === SUPERSEDED && latestRead !== awaited)` → `while (true && …)`
  in `readUntilSettled` (D17). **Not equivalent, and not deterministically
  killable.** It would make `login()` wait for a newer read even when its own
  confirm answered — a state that needs a read to be issued in the gap between
  `runLoadSession`'s epoch check and `login()`'s next microtask, which no spec
  can arrange without pinning the scheduler rather than the behaviour. The
  condition is still load-bearing: without it a busy app's `login()` chases each
  later read in turn. The _other_ half of the same line is killed three times
  over — `&&` → `||`, `latestRead !== awaited` → `true`, and an emptied loop body
  all TIME OUT, because dropping the break wedges the event loop outright.

## D12 — A primed store forwards what it primed

_Fix round 1, 2026-09-14._

`createHttpService` defaults `withXSRFToken` to **`false`**. A store configured
with `csrf` therefore primed a cookie and then sent every request without the
header derived from it: the prime accomplished nothing, and a cross-origin login
drew exactly the 419 the prime existed to prevent — on every attempt, retry
included.

So a `csrf`-configured store sends `{timeout, withCredentials: true,
withXSRFToken: true}` on **every** request it makes, the prime included. The
credentials flag rides along because the prime itself must be allowed to store
the cookie across the origin boundary.

A store with **no** `csrf` block overrides nothing. It has claimed nothing about
the origin boundary, so the injected service's own configuration is what it uses
— the package does not reach in and decide for a consumer that never asked.

Consequence for `createCsrfPrimer`: its third argument is the request options
object rather than a bare `timeoutMs`. A caller priming across an origin
boundary owes it `withCredentials`.

## D13 — A defect propagates; an answer becomes an outcome

_Fix round 1, 2026-09-14. Closes a gap between this package's own docs and its code._

The rule: **only an HTTP answer, or an axios rejection recording the absence of
one, becomes a session state or an outcome.** Anything else reaching the store is
broken, and a defect that dressed itself as `outage` or as `refused` is
indistinguishable from a real one forever — the shell shows "please try again"
for a fault nobody will ever read (ADR-0048).

Two places were laundering one:

- `parseUser` ran inside the transport `try`, so a throwing consumer type guard
  was caught, classified `outage`, and reported by `login()` as `refused`. It now
  runs **outside** that `try` and its throw propagates. A superseded read never
  calls it at all, so a discarded answer cannot fire a late defect.
- A non-axios rejection from the transport became `outage` on `loadSession()` and
  `refused` on `login()`. Both now rethrow it. fs-http rejects a non-axios error
  untouched, so nothing legitimate arrives that way.

**`logout()` was carved out, and the carve-out is withdrawn.**

_Amended 2026-09-16, fix round 5._

The original entry exempted `logout()`: any failure, a defect included, became
`{kind: 'failed'}` with `status` and `body` `undefined`, on the argument that
ruling 1 (D1) says _any_ failure leaves the session standing, and that a throw
would strand a shell mid-sign-out.

The argument does not hold, and it is worth saying why rather than just
reversing it. **Ruling 1 is about the MACHINE** — it moves on success only. A
rethrown defect moves the machine exactly as much as a `failed` outcome does,
which is not at all: `state` and `user` are untouched either way and no listener
fires. So nothing in ruling 1 was ever being protected by swallowing the defect.
What the carve-out actually bought was a programming fault wearing a transport
failure's precise clothes — `failed` with no status and no body is what a
network drop looks like, the one shape a consumer is most likely to render as
"try again" and never read (ADR-0048). A third round of review found it, and it
took three rounds because the entry stated the exemption confidently.

Both `catch` blocks in `logout()` — the prime's and the POST's — now rethrow
when the rejection is not an axios error, exactly as `login()` does. The
`failed` outcome is unchanged for every rejection that IS one, so the person's
question (press it again?) is still answered whenever there is anything to
answer it with. `statusOf`/`bodyOf`, which existed only to read a status off
something that might not have one, are gone with it.

The rule now has **no exceptions**: a defect propagates from every operation on
this store.

## D14 — `signed_out` clears the user; `outage` keeps it

_Fix round 1, 2026-09-14._

`state` and `user` are written **together**. Writing the machine to `signed_out`
without clearing `user` leaves the previous identity readable behind a dead
session, and a shell keeps rendering a name for somebody who is gone. Every
sign-out path now runs through one of two functions, and both write both.

And every exit **out of `authenticated` into `signed_out`** goes through
`endSession` exactly once, so the consumer hears about it. That was already true
of `handleSessionExpired`; it is now also true of a revalidating `me` that
answers 401 or 419 — by ADR-0050's own rule those two statuses are one class with
one action, and the session ending because a background read discovered it is the
same event as one ending because a request was refused mid-flight. The event
carries no `returnTo` on that path: `loadSession` does not know where the person
is.

From any state **other** than `authenticated`, a 401 still writes `signed_out`
and clears the user but fires **nothing**. Arriving at a login screen with no
session is not an event; there was nothing to end.

`outage` is the opposite case and **retains `user`**. The ADR is explicit that an
outage is never a sign-out, so the identity is still presumed good and a shell
can keep naming it behind a notice. Clearing it would render a broken API as a
sign-out by another route — the exact substitution the `outage` state exists to
prevent. `isAuthenticated` is false throughout, and `setUser` throws, so nothing
can mistake a retained name for a live session.

## D15 — Ending a session stales every read issued before it

_Fix round 2, 2026-09-14._

A session that has ended must not be revived by an answer that predates its
ending. Before this, `clearSession` wrote the machine and left the read epoch
alone, so a `loadSession()` already in flight still held a live ticket:

1. `loadSession()` takes ticket 1 and awaits `me`.
2. `logout()` succeeds — state `signed_out`, user cleared, listeners told.
3. The ticket-1 `me` answers 200 with a good body. Its ticket is still current,
   `parseUser` succeeds, and the store writes `authenticated` with the user back.

The consumer regains guarded access on a session the server has closed, on the
strength of an answer that was already stale when it arrived — and nothing
anywhere is in an error state, which is ADR-0048's failure mode exactly. The
expiry path had the same hole, and there it is worse: `handleSessionExpired`
runs synchronously inside fs-http's error loop, so a concurrent `me` is the
likeliest thing in the world to be in flight at that moment.

`clearSession` now advances the epoch **before** it writes, so every read issued
earlier is stale when it lands. Both ending paths route through it, which is why
the rule attaches there rather than to `endSession`: the bare-clear path (a 401
arriving when no session was live) needs it just as much.

Reads issued **after** the end are untouched and still commit — signing back in
is legitimate, and both `loadSession()` and `login()`'s confirming read take
their ticket at the moment they run. Spec'd in both directions, because a rule
that staled those too would be a worse bug than the one it fixed.

Seed: lokalekeuze ruled this shape as **LK-0291 rule 2** — _"the slot is
invalidated BEFORE the write"_ (`apps/employer/domains/auth/stores/session.ts`,
`logout()`). Same hazard, same ordering, arrived at independently there first.

## D16 — One session, one event

_Fix round 3, 2026-09-16._

`logout()` fired a session-end event after every successful POST, whatever the
machine was doing. `endSession` cleared and notified unconditionally, and the
only guard anywhere read `state.value === 'authenticated'` inside
`handleSessionExpired`. So one session could produce two events:

1. `logout()`'s POST is in flight.
2. A 401 on another request runs `handleSessionExpired` synchronously inside
   fs-http's error loop — `{reason: 'expired'}` fires, state is `signed_out`.
3. The logout POST resolves and `{reason: 'logout'}` fires on top of it.

Two logouts pressed together do the same thing, and a consumer whose listener
navigates or shows a notice does it twice. The ADR says once, the README says
once, and nothing checked.

**The invariant: a session-end event is emitted only for a transition out of a
session that was live.** It is enforced in `endSession` and nowhere else,
because `endSession` is the only place a listener is ever called — the second
logout, the logout behind an expiry and the 401 arriving at a login screen are
all the same question, asked once. The machine is read **before** the clear,
which is what keeps it single-flight: the first caller through writes
`signed_out` with no await in between, so N callers in one tick produce one
event.

**`outage` holds a session.** It retains the user (D14), so a shell is still
naming somebody; ending it is a transition a consumer has to hear about. This
is the half a guard written as "authenticated only" gets wrong, and it is
spec'd from both directions — a logout out of `outage` fires, a logout out of
`signed_out` does not. It also means `handleSessionExpired` now acts from
`outage`, where before it returned: a 401 is the server saying the identity
that state still names is gone.

**The clear stays unconditional.** A successful logout moves the machine
whatever it was doing — the server has spoken, and leaving it `loading` would
state a session nobody has. Only the _notification_ is gated. Reverting to
"return before clearing" reds eight specs, several of them older than this
round: the bare-clear path a 401 takes when nothing is live depends on it.

`handleSessionExpired` keeps an early return, reading the same predicate. That
is not a second copy of the guard but a different question — it is a registrar
callback about _some_ request, so a 401 arriving while nothing is live must
leave the machine entirely alone. Clearing there would take a read ticket
(D15) and stale a `loadSession()` in flight, signing somebody out of an initial
load on the strength of a refusal that was never about their session.

**What a stale button press does:** the POST is still sent. Ruling 1 says the
machine moves on success and says nothing about skipping the request, and the
caller still gets `{kind: 'signed_out'}` — the server did sign it out. What it
does not get is an event for a session that had already ended.

## D17 — A superseded login confirm waits for the machine

_Fix round 3, 2026-09-16._

`login()` awaited its confirming `me` and then decided from `state.value`
alone. `runLoadSession` returns the `SUPERSEDED` sentinel when a newer read took
a ticket while it was in flight — an answer nothing was done with — and
`login()` read that as if it were an answer. Two consequences, one harmful:

- **A false refusal.** A consumer-initiated `loadSession()` (focus
  revalidation, a concurrent navigation's own read) overlaps the confirm. The
  confirm comes back superseded and unparsed, the newer read has not landed,
  `state` is still `loading`, and `login()` answers
  `{kind: 'refused', status: undefined, body: undefined}` for a login the
  server accepted. The person is shown a failure and their session is live.
- **A stale success.** Login A's confirm is superseded by login B's; A reads
  B's `authenticated` and reports success.

**The invariant: `login()` answers from a machine state that a read issued at
or after its own POST has settled** — never from a `loading` left by a read
still in flight, and never from an answer that was discarded.

_Amended 2026-09-21, 0.2.0._ The invariant is unchanged and the KIND it answers
with is not: when that settled state is anything but `authenticated`, the answer
is `{kind: 'unconfirmed'}` (D22). Every path below that used to read `refused`
now reads `unconfirmed`, the superseded-by-a-sign-out case included — a confirm
with nothing left to wait for still reports that the POST was accepted.

The store now tracks the newest read as the promise that settles it. A confirm
that comes back superseded waits for that one instead, and repeats while it is
overtaken too. The false refusal disappears, because by the time `login()`
reads the machine the read that overtook its confirm has written it.

**Promise identity, not a second epoch.** `issued` stays the only ordering
authority; the tracked promise answers a different question — is there a newer
_read_ still to settle. It has to be a different question, because
`clearSession` also takes a ticket and issues **no read** (D15). A confirm
superseded by a sign-out therefore has nothing left to wait for, and a wait
keyed on the epoch alone would wait forever. Removing that one condition wedges
the process rather than failing a test, which is why it has a spec of its own.

**The alternative that was rejected:** having `login()` issue a _fresh_ read on
a supersede. It costs an extra request, and two overlapping logins would
supersede each other's re-reads in turn — an unbounded exchange to answer a
question neither caller can act on.

**The residual is accepted and not solved.** Two logins from one browser both
answer `authenticated`, and `user` holds the later one. Whose credentials won
is a server fact; the package cannot name it, and D5 already says `login()`
answers what the machine says. The alternative is a fourth `LoginOutcome` arm
that every consumer must switch on, for a case the package would have to
describe wrongly. Two concurrent logins are a consumer's double-submit, and
single-flighting `login()` is a different invariant from this one — if it is
wanted, it is argued here first.

**How a consumer tells an outage refusal from a credential refusal.**
`{kind: 'refused', status: undefined}` is what both a transport failure and a
discarded answer used to look like. The discriminator was the machine, readable
alongside the outcome and settled by the time `login()` answers.

_Amended 2026-09-21, 0.2.0: the KIND is now the first discriminator and the
machine is the second._ A refusal the server issued on the POST is `refused`; a
confirm that did not land is `unconfirmed`, and `state.value` then says whether
the API failed to answer (`outage`) or answered that there is no session
(`signed_out`). The machine has still settled by the time `login()` answers, and
`user` still follows D14 across an outage — that half is unchanged.

## D18 — Two findings deferred, by name

_Fix round 3, 2026-09-16. Recorded so nobody re-derives them from the code._

Both were raised on PR #255, both are mechanically real, and both are deferred
rather than fixed. Refute-and-defer, with a row each.

**(a) `registerUnauthorizedMiddleware` is unscoped — WR-1441.** A 401 on a
service shared by two stores runs every registered handler, so one guard's
refusal expires the other guard's session. No fleet consumer has that shape:
kendo builds two `createHttpService` instances, isms and lokalekeuze register
one guard per SPA bundle. This package's own two-store spec — _"gives two
stores their own prime, so one cannot spend the other's"_ — shares a stub
`http` object as a **convenience of the fixture, and states no contract**; it
is about the primer, not about the middleware. The fix is an additive option
(scope the handler to a URL predicate or the store's guard) in 0.2.0, where it
can be designed rather than bolted on.

**(b) An older logout response can clear a newer login — WR-1442.** A logout
POST still in flight when a login completes clears the session the login just
established. Concurrent login and logout from one browser is a double-press,
the client cannot order effects the server applied in its own order, and the
failing direction is fail-safe: the consumer is signed out locally while the
cookie is live, and the next `me` restores the session. Ordering mutations
would need a mutation epoch beside the read epoch, which is in tension with
ruling 1 (the machine moves on logout SUCCESS only) and is a design item, not a
fix round.

WR-1442 also carries the three-round trigger: **a fourth concurrency finding on
`session-store.ts` is a spike, not another fix round.** Three rounds have now
each found a real interleaving defect in this one file, which is the shape the
war room's three-round rule exists to catch — the next one is a question about
the design, not a patch.

## D19 — A refusal of the store's own credential exchange is an outcome, never an expiry

_Fix round 4, 2026-09-16._

fs-http runs **every** response-error middleware before it rejects to the
caller's `catch` (`packages/http/src/http.ts`, the response interceptor's error
arm). `registerUnauthorizedMiddleware` discriminated on status alone. So the
expiry hook read refusals the store was a microtask away from turning into an
outcome, and did it first:

- A primed store that is live draws a **stale-token 419 on its login POST** —
  the exact refusal the one retry exists to recover from. The hook ended the
  session before the retry ran, and the retry then succeeded: a session-end
  event the consumer acted on, for a session that never ended.
- A **logout POST answering 401/419** produced an `expired` event from the hook
  and a `failed` outcome from `logout()` — two signals that contradict each
  other, about the same request.

Neither was reachable by any spec in this package, and that is the part worth
recording: the retry specs stub `postRequest` directly, and the registrar specs
call the middleware by hand. Each half was right on its own. The composition had
never been executed, so `tests/composition.spec.ts` now drives both over a real
`createHttpService` with only the adapter replaced.

**The invariant: a refusal of a request whose outcome the store already returns
to its caller is that caller's to read, and never the hook's.**

`SessionExpiryHandler` widens by one question — `ownsRefusalOf(url)` — and the
**store** answers it, because the store owns the endpoint strings. A list handed
to the registrar instead would be a copy with nothing keeping it in step, which
is a claim rather than a mechanism. The hook stays a filter and reads no
endpoint of its own.

The set is the store's login, its logout, and **the CSRF prime in front of
either**. The prime is one string beyond the two the review named, and it is the
identical hole: `login()` already returns a refused prime as
`{kind: 'refused'}` and `logout()` as `{kind: 'failed'}`, so the hook firing on
it is the same defect with the same shape. It is spec'd over the real service
like the other two.

**`me` joined the set too** — _amended 2026-09-16, fix round 7, finding
`c2c787c1265f`._ It was left out on the argument that a refused `me` _is_ the
session ending underneath the consumer, with nobody waiting on an outcome. True,
and beside the point: the question is not who is waiting but **who can judge**.

A `me` refusal is judged by the read epoch — `runLoadSession` discards an answer
whose ticket is stale before it touches the machine (D15). The hook runs
**before** fs-http rejects, so it reaches the machine before that check can run.
The epoch cannot protect a path that executes ahead of it. Interleaving: read A
takes ticket 1; read B takes ticket 2 and commits `authenticated`; A's late 401
arrives, the hook clears B's perfectly valid session and fires `expired`.

So the invariant is wider than the one this entry first stated: **every refusal
of a request the store issued is judged by the store's own epoch-checked path;
the hook judges only OTHER requests.** The fix removes the carve-out rather than
adding a mechanism — `endpoints.me` joins `ownEndpoints` and `runLoadSession`'s
existing 401 branch is the single judge.

The honest consequence: a `me`-detected expiry now carries **no `returnTo`**,
because `loadSession` does not know where the person is. Round 4 narrowed this
package's docs the other way, on the strength of the behaviour this round
removes; they are narrowed back. A consumer that wants a return-to on a
background revalidation reads it in its own listener, where it has one.

This does not close WR-1441 and does not touch it: two stores sharing one
service still both hear a 401 raised for either. It narrows that surface
slightly — each store now skips its own credential exchange — and the deferred
fix (scoping a handler to its own store) is unchanged.

## D20 — Every `onSessionEnd` registration is its own subscription

_Fix round 5, 2026-09-16._

`listeners` was a `Set` of the listener functions themselves, so registration
was keyed on function identity. Two registrations of the **same** function
collapsed into one entry, and the unregister returned by either removed it for
both.

That is not an exotic shape. A module-level handler — one `signOut` function
imported by two components — is the ordinary way a consumer writes this. Both
components register; one unmounts and calls its unregister; the other is still
mounted and **silently stops hearing session ends**. Nothing throws and nothing
logs; the session simply ends one day and that component does not react. It is
the ADR-0048 failure mode arriving as silence.

The fix is one entry per **registration**: `onSessionEnd` puts the listener in a
fresh `{listener}` wrapper, adds that, and the unregister closure deletes the
wrapper it captured. Two registrations are two entries, fire twice, and
unregister independently. Insertion order is preserved (a `Set` iterates in
insertion order), and D8's per-listener `try/catch` is untouched — it wraps the
same call, one indirection further in.

The cost, stated plainly: **a listener registered twice is now called twice per
event.** That is the correct reading of two subscriptions, and the old
behaviour was not a de-duplication feature — no entry, no doc and no spec ever
argued for it; a spec asserted it, which is not the same thing, and that spec is
reversed here. A consumer that wants one call registers once.

The near-miss worth recording: keeping the wrapper but having the unregister
sweep every entry whose `.listener` matches is the fix a careless hand writes,
and it restores the whole defect. It reds exactly one spec, which is why that
spec exists.

## D21 — The prime URL is on the API's host, and the docs said otherwise

_Fix round 6, 2026-09-16. Finding `a3f22c91ae31`._

**The invariant: Sanctum's cookie is issued by the Laravel app that guards the
API, so the prime URL is on the API's host** — at that app's root rather than
under the API path, which makes it a PATH difference from the base URL and never
another host.

The mechanism the review found is real, and measured here rather than reasoned
about. `createHttpService`'s `smartCredentials` option registers a request
middleware assigning `request.withCredentials = apiUrl.host === requestUrl.host`
(`packages/http/src/http.ts`). Request middleware runs **after** per-request
options are merged, so it overwrites what the caller asked for. Against a real
service with `smartCredentials: true` and a store sending
`{withCredentials: true, withXSRFToken: true}` on every request (D12):

| prime URL                               | `withCredentials` on the wire |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| the SPA's origin (what the docs showed) | **`false`**                   |
| the API's origin                        | `true`                        |
| a relative endpoint                     | `true`                        |
| the SPA's origin, no `smartCredentials` | `true`                        |

An uncredentialed prime drops the `Set-Cookie`, and every login then draws the
419 the prime existed to prevent — D12's failure mode by another route.

**The trigger was our own documentation, not the code.** The example read
``primeUrl: `${globalThis.location.origin}/sanctum/csrf-cookie` `` — the SPA's
origin — while the prose two lines down said the route "lives at the app root",
meaning the _Laravel_ app. The two disagreed, and the example is what gets
copied. It is invisible on a same-origin consumer, where the SPA origin and the
API host are the same string, and wrong in exactly the cross-origin case the
`csrf` block is documented as existing for. That is the shape worth remembering:
**an example that is right for the configuration the option does not apply to.**

Corroboration from a consumer that got there independently: scripthub's own
`http.ts` primes from `${apiOrigin}` "so it stays one source of truth" and
carries a comment refusing `smartCredentials` outright, because it "only
attaches credentials same-origin, which would silently drop the cookie in this
cross-origin setup". The invariant was already known in the field; only this
package's docs said otherwise.

**Why the package asserts none of this in code.** The store is never told the
API base URL — the injected service owns it, and this package creates no
service and reads no browser global (D4). It cannot compare hosts because it
knows only one of them. What it _can_ do is refuse to guess, which it already
does: `primeUrl` is an opaque string it neither builds nor rewrites.

If the assertion belongs anywhere it is **fs-http's** side, where both halves are
in hand — `smartCredentials` could resolve the request through `getUri` and warn
when it strips credentials a caller explicitly asked for, rather than silently
winning. That is a sibling package's decision and is recorded here as an
observation, not a ticket.

A spec pins the measured behaviour in both directions, because a table in a
decisions file is a claim and the composition spec is where this package's
cross-package claims get checked. It binds fs-http's **built** artifact, which is
what a consumer resolves — so proving it has teeth means mutating fs-http's
source and rebuilding; a mutation without the rebuild leaves the suite green and
proves nothing.

## D22 — A refused POST and an unconfirmed session are two answers

_2026-09-21, Commander ruling ("yes to the two shapes"). 0.2.0, breaking. WR-1588._

`login()` ended with `return {kind: 'refused', status: me.status, body: me.body}`
— so a POST the server **accepted**, whose confirming `me` then failed to
establish a session, was answered as a refusal. The status on it was the `me`
answer's, not the POST's, and nothing in the type said so.

**The invariant: `refused` means the login POST was refused, or never answered.
Nothing else may produce it.** Its two sources are the rejected POST and the
rejected stale-token retry, both through `refusalOf`. A confirm that does not
authenticate is the new `unconfirmed` arm, and it is that arm's only source.

**Why it is not a copy problem.** The package renders no sentences (D7), so the
consumer picks the words — and with one arm for both facts, the only words
available for either were the refusal's. lokalekeuze ruled the same shape
independently as **LK-0327 rule G**: a 2xx login whose probe finds no session
renders the UNREACHABLE sentence and never the credential refusal, _because the
credentials are not what went wrong_. Offering the password again is the one
instruction that cannot help, and it is what a `refused` arm asks a consumer to
write.

**`status` on `unconfirmed` is the ME answer's, deliberately.** The POST's status
is not interesting on this path — it was a 2xx, that is what put the caller here.
What the consumer needs is why the confirm did not land, and `state.value` is
read alongside it for the half a status cannot carry: `outage` is "the API did
not answer", `signed_out` is "it answered that there is no session". The comment
on the arm says exactly that, and it is here rather than only there because it
names a limitation the type cannot.

**No fifth state, and no further arm.** The Commander's ruling was "not too much
deviation from fs-auth itself": the four-state machine stands, and a consumer's
richer vocabulary — lokalekeuze's `rate_limited | network | server`, its
`blocked` — is a classification over what these outcomes carry (D23). A fifth
state would put the package in the business of naming causes it learns about
only through a status it did not interpret.

**The cost, stated plainly: this is breaking, before any consumer exists.** An
exhaustive `switch` on `kind` stops compiling, which is the point — a consumer
that had handled all three arms has a fourth fact to decide about, and silently
folding it into the default would reintroduce the defect. There are **zero**
consumers on npm today (nine territory manifests read at dispatch), so the cost
is paid by nobody and is paid now rather than after LK-0732 adopts.

**What it retires.** The docs carried a workaround for the missing arm —
_"`refused` with no `status` is therefore the machine's answer and not a
discarded one: read `state.value` alongside the outcome"_. That sentence asked
every consumer to re-derive a distinction the type now makes. It is gone.

## D23 — `loadSession()` answers what THIS read wrote

_2026-09-21, Commander ruling. 0.2.0, breaking. WR-1588._

`loadSession()` returned `void` while `runLoadSession` already computed
everything a caller could want and threw it away: the status, the body, and the
state it had just written. A consumer that needed any of it re-read the machine
afterwards, which is a different question with a different answer.

**The invariant: the returned `state` is the value this read wrote at the moment
it wrote it — never a later read's.** It is captured inside `runLoadSession`, in
the same synchronous block as the write, with no `await` between. Reading
`state.value` after the await in `loadSession()` would be the defect this entry
exists to avoid: a concurrent read that landed in between would have moved the
machine, and the caller would be handed a fact about somebody else's request.
That is the shape enforcement-queue row 227 names on lokalekeuze.

`state.value` read synchronously, rather than a literal per branch: the write is
two lines up and the read cannot observe anything else, so the value is this
read's by construction **and** stays true if either branch's write is ever
changed. A literal would be a copy of the write with nothing keeping it in step
— a claim rather than a mechanism, the same argument D19 makes about the
endpoint list.

**`undefined` for an overtaken read, and no `superseded` arm.** A read a newer
one overtook wrote nothing, so it has nothing to report; there is no partial
answer to describe and no state to name. The `SUPERSEDED` sentinel stays
**private** — `readUntilSettled` compares against it by identity and that is
internal ordering, not a fact a consumer should learn. `MeOutcome` is therefore
split in two (`MeAnswer | SupersededOutcome`) so `state === undefined` narrows at
the public boundary without a cast, and `login()`'s existing reads of
`me.status` / `me.body` are untouched on the union.

**The consumer classifies; the package does not.** This is the other half of
D22's "no fifth state". A consumer derives its own vocabulary from what the read
carries, and none of these is a state this package holds:

| What the read says                                   | The consumer's own name |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `status === 429`                                     | `rate_limited`          |
| `status === undefined` and `state === 'outage'`      | `network`               |
| `status === 403` and its own reason-reader on `body` | `blocked`               |

lokalekeuze's beheer store (LK-0732, the first consumer) is exactly this reader:
its `loadSession(): Promise<SessionState | undefined>` already answers _"what
this probe wrote — never merely `void`"_, with `undefined` meaning superseded,
and two callers plus a `confirmedByProbe()` read it. The package now supplies
what that consumer had to build, and supplies the status and body it could not
reach at all.

**The cost: breaking, and for the same reason D22's is.** The return type widens
from `Promise<void>`, so a consumer assigning it somewhere typed `void` stops
compiling. Zero consumers on npm; the cost is paid by nobody.

**The residual, named rather than solved.** A consumer that awaits a read and
then reads `state.value` still gets the machine's current value, not the read's —
the package cannot stop that and should not try. What it can do is make the
read's own answer available, so reaching for the machine is a choice rather than
the only option.
